# Huffman Encoding Compression and Decompression

## Overview
This project implements Huffman Encoding for compressing and decompressing text files. Huffman Encoding is a popular algorithm used for lossless data compression, which works by assigning variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters.

## Features of Huffman Encoding
* **Compression**: Compresses text files using Huffman Encoding.
* **Decompression**: Decompresses the compressed files back to their original form.
* **Efficient** : Achieves significant reduction in file size for text files with high redundancy.

## Getting Started
* Run the python code `useHuffman.py` to compress & decompress the given sample file. For eg. open terminal and run `python useHuffman.py`
* The above command will perform compression and decompression on the sample.txt file present here. Both the compressed and decompressed file will be present at the same location.
